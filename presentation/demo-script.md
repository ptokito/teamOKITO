## üé≠ Demo Flow

### Phase 1: Setting the Stage (5 minutes)

#### Opening Statement
> "Today, we're going to explore how Configuration as Code transforms the way organizations manage their CI/CD systems. We'll see both the challenges of manual configuration and the solutions that Configuration as Code provides."

#### Current State Discussion
- **Ask the audience**: "How many of you have experienced configuration drift or deployment failures?"
- **Show statistics**: "According to industry data, 60% of deployment failures are caused by configuration issues"
- **Present the problem**: Manual configuration management leads to:
  - Inconsistencies between environments
  - Human errors during configuration changes
  - Difficult troubleshooting and rollback
  - Compliance and audit challenges

### Phase 2: Problem Demonstration (10 minutes)

#### Show Manual Configuration Issues
1. **Navigate to TeamCity UI**:
   - Go to a project with manual configuration
   - Show build configuration settings
   - Highlight the manual nature of changes

2. **Demonstrate Configuration Drift**:
   - Show different settings between similar projects
   - Point out inconsistencies in build steps
   - Explain how this happens over time

3. **Simulate a Configuration Change**:
   - Make a small change in the UI
   - Show that the change is not tracked
   - Explain the risk of undocumented changes

#### Interactive Element
> "Let's say we need to add a new build step. In the traditional approach, I would go to the UI, make the change, and hope I remember to document it. Sound familiar?"

---

### Phase 3: Solution Introduction (15 minutes)

#### Configuration as Code Overview
1. **Explain the Concept**:
   - "Configuration as Code treats your CI/CD settings like application code"
   - "Everything is stored in version control with full audit trail"
   - "Changes go through the same review process as code changes"

2. **Show the Repository Structure**:
   - Navigate to the demo repository
   - Show the `.teamcity` directory
   - Explain the different configuration formats

#### Live Configuration Demonstration
1. **Show Kotlin DSL Configuration**:
   ```kotlin
   // Open .teamcity/Project.kt
   buildType {
       id = "BuildAndTest"
       name = "Build and Test"
       // Explain the structure
   }
   ```

2. **Explain the Benefits**:
   - Type-safe configuration
   - IDE support with autocomplete
   - Version control integration
   - Reusable patterns

3. **Show Alternative Formats**:
   - XML configuration (familiar to many developers)
   - YAML configuration (human-readable)
   - Explain when to use each

### Phase 4: Live Configuration Change (10 minutes)

#### Making a Configuration Change
1. **Edit Configuration File**:
   - Open the configuration file in an IDE
   - Make a visible change (e.g., add a new build step)
   - Show the change in the editor

2. **Version Control Process**:
   - Commit the change with a meaningful message
   - Push to the repository
   - Show the Git history

3. **Automatic TeamCity Update**:
   - Navigate back to TeamCity
   - Show the automatic configuration import
   - Verify the change is applied

#### Interactive Element
> "Now let's see what happens when I push this change. Watch how TeamCity automatically picks up the new configuration without any manual intervention."

---

### Phase 5: Benefits Demonstration (10 minutes)

#### Show Key Benefits
1. **Version Control and Audit Trail**:
   - Show Git history of configuration changes
   - Explain how this helps with compliance
   - Demonstrate rollback capability

2. **Consistency Across Environments**:
   - Show how the same configuration applies everywhere
   - Explain environment parity benefits
   - Demonstrate quick environment replication

3. **Team Collaboration**:
   - Show pull request workflow for configuration changes
   - Explain code review process
   - Highlight knowledge sharing benefits

#### Real-World Scenarios
1. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - "What if our TeamCity server goes down?"
   - Show how configuration can be restored from Git
   - Demonstrate the speed of recovery

2. **Environment Scaling**:
   - "What if we need to set up a new environment?"
   - Show how configuration can be cloned
   - Explain the time savings

---

### Phase 6: Business Impact (5 minutes)

#### Quantify the Benefits
1. **Cost Savings**:
   - Reduced manual configuration time
   - Fewer deployment failures
   - Faster environment setup

2. **Risk Reduction**:
   - Eliminated configuration drift
   - Full audit trail for compliance
   - Quick rollback capability

3. **Operational Efficiency**:
   - Faster deployments
   - Consistent environments
   - Better team productivity

#### Interactive Discussion
> "For the business stakeholders in the room: What would it mean to your organization if you could eliminate 60% of deployment failures? What's the cost of a single production outage?"

---

## üéØ Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Adding a New Build Step
**Setup**: Have a simple configuration ready  
**Action**: Add a new Maven goal to the build  
**Demonstration**: Show the entire process from code change to TeamCity update  

### Scenario 2: Environment Configuration
**Setup**: Show different environment settings  
**Action**: Modify environment-specific parameters  
**Demonstration**: Show how changes propagate across environments  

### Scenario 3: Rollback Demonstration
**Setup**: Make a configuration change that "breaks" something  
**Action**: Show the rollback process  
**Demonstration**: Demonstrate quick recovery using Git

### Questions for Non-Technical Stakeholders
- "How much time does your team spend on configuration management?"
- "What's the cost of a production deployment failure?"
- "How do you currently ensure compliance with configuration changes?"

### Questions for Technical Teams
- "How do you currently manage configuration drift?"
- "What's your process for rolling back configuration changes?"
- "How do you ensure consistency across environments?"

### Group Discussion Points
- "What are the biggest challenges you face with CI/CD configuration?"
- "How would Configuration as Code impact your current workflow?"
- "What would be the first project you'd want to migrate?"

## üö® Handling Demo Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

1. **Configuration Import Fails**:
   - **Problem**: TeamCity doesn't pick up configuration changes
   - **Solution**: Check VCS root settings and Configuration as Code enablement
   - **Backup**: Have screenshots ready to show the process

2. **Build Fails During Demo**:
   - **Problem**: Sample project doesn't build successfully
   - **Solution**: Have a working backup configuration ready
   - **Backup**: Use pre-recorded video if necessary

3. **Network Issues**:
   - **Problem**: Can't access TeamCity or repository
   - **Solution**: Have offline demos and screenshots prepared
   - **Backup**: Use local TeamCity instance if possible

### Demo Recovery Strategies
- **Keep backup materials ready**: Screenshots, videos, alternative demos
- **Practice the demo multiple times**: Ensure smooth execution
- **Have fallback scenarios**: Different ways to demonstrate the same concept
- **Maintain audience engagement**: Keep them involved even if technology fails
